## Tabla Beats

An exploration of random tabla rhythms as generated by a Markov Chain sampled on notes by my tabla teacher  
See the final version here: https://tabla-beats-me-again.glitch.me/  
My first jab at it: https://tabla-beats.glitch.me/

### Samples used in the app are located in ./assets

### I gave a talk about this [@PyData Delhi 2019](https://pydata.org/delhi2019/schedule/presentation/26/generating-tabla-note-sequences-markov-chains-and-processingp5js/), slides are posted [here](./JoshiKeshav_PyDataDelhi19_GenerativeTabla.pdf)

### Future directions
I am planning (at some point):
- to add more sequence information as a prior dataset to sample the Markov Chain
- to add more detailed time-signatures
- to make playing predefined patterns more interactive
- explore the latent-space of tabla rhythms
